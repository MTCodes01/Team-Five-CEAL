# HVH üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Team Five
### Team Members
- **Sreedev S S (Team Lead)** - College of Engineering, Attingal
- **Harigovind P Nair** - College of Engineering, Attingal

### Project Description
The ultimate AFK (Away From Keyboard) timer that celebrates your commitment to doing absolutely nothing. It's a sophisticated procrastination tool that rewards stillness and punishes productivity with zen points and philosophical enlightenment.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In today's hyper-productive world, people are constantly moving, clicking, typing, and being useful. There's a severe lack of appreciation for the ancient art of sitting perfectly still and accomplishing nothing. How do we measure and gamify our commitment to inactivity?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our revolutionary AFK Timer tracks your motionlessness with scientific precision, awards zen points for stillness, delivers philosophical insights about doing nothing, and celebrates your achievements in the noble pursuit of absolutely zero productivity. Complete with glassmorphism UI because even procrastination deserves to look premium!

## Technical Details
